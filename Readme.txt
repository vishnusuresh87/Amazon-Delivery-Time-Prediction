Business Understanding

Delivery time prediction is an important aspect for logistics, e-commerce, and supply chain management companies because correct predictions can improve customer satisfaction, smoothen internal operations, and optimize the bottom line.
The global logistics market was valued at US$9.5 trillion in 2022, and it is expected to surge since e-commerce is also at an upward trajectory. Therefore, effective predictive systems have turned unavoidable.
The dataset we chose concentrates on the logistics of Amazon's deliveries, providing valuable insights into various business requirements, including delivery time analysis. By examining this data, we can predict and assess the delivery time, performance of delivery agents, determine optimal routes, and evaluate customer satisfaction. Additionally, it offers insights for the company regarding workforce planning.
In today's world, time is money. The quicker we deliver, the higher the customer satisfaction and retention rates. Therefore, our ability to deliver efficiently and quickly is crucial for maintaining customer loyalty. Better understanding of the dynamics of delivery time is key to the effectiveness of a business model.


Problem Statement

The objective is to predict the delivery time taken by the agents considering different factors including location, weather, traffic, mode of transport, area, and category using suitable machine learning algorithms. We use the historical Amazon delivery data, train and develop different machine learning models using the dataset, and evaluate the performance of each model on train and test data using different evaluation matrices, to identify the perfect machine learning model to predict the delivery time.
